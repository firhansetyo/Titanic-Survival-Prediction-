### **🔍 Dataset Overview**
Detail | Information
Total Records | 500 rows
Key Columns | `name`, `sex`, `age`, `survived`
Missing Values | 9.82% missing in `age` column
Feature Engineering | Created `title` and `age_group` columns
---

### **📊 Project Workflow**
1. Import Libraries
2. Load and Explore Dataset
3. Data Cleaning
   - Handling missing values
   - Dropping/engineering columns
4. Data Visualization
   - Gender distribution
   - Age distribution
   - Survival rate by gender
   - Correlation between age and survival
5. Insight Extraction
---

### **🎯 Key Insights**
1. Women had a significantly higher survival rate compared to men.
2. Younger passengers (children) tended to have better survival chances.
3. Missing values in age were handled carefully to avoid bias.

---

### **📈 Visualizations**
Here are some example visualizations from this project:
 - Bar chart of gender distribution
 - Histogram of age distribution
 - Scatter plot of age vs survival status
 - Bar plot of average survival rate by gender

(Visuals are included inside the notebook.)
